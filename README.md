# Buckeye Catcher

## What is Buckeye Catcher?
Buckeye Catcher is a coding game aimed at helping grade school students learn the basics of computer science.  Students can learn code through our C4C built coding lanugage that removes any confusing and scary syntax.

## What is the goal of Buckeye Catcher?
The goal of Buckeye Catcher is to create a program or algorithm to move the Brutus Buckeye around the screen to catch the falling buckeyes.

Game ends after 30 seconds automatically. Objective is to rack up points, +10 for every good item caught, -5 for every bad item.
Their code should not automatically be in an infinite loop. If they write moveleft and moveright, those two movements will happen and then the basket will sit for the rest of the time.

# Todo/Ideas

### Important
- [ ] Make the game display smaller.

### Less Important
- [ ] Cheer and boo. Have visual indicators (something popping up from bottom). When Brutus pokes his head out, a buckeye will be in that column 1 second later. The word "boo" for Michigan logo.
- [ ] Add high score system. The points increase each level (level 1 is like 10/-5 whereas level 2 is like 20/-10 or something).

### Ideas
- [ ] If they catch every good thing they get a bonus. Also for avoiding every bad thing. Maybe like a big "Perfect" bonus. Could add multipliers for consecutive successes.
