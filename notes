Merge notes

Create a new branch to do merging in.

Separate script.js in graphics_2 into start, ready, and ingame.
Create a class in script.js that has a reference to the Phaser game object and has functions like moveleft.
This maybe could be initialized in ready.
Add some way to get boolean values to that class too.

Initialize lang array in language.js within the interpreter.

Flip the execution so that there's a step() function in Interpreter and we just keep calling that. Then setTimeout or setInterval.
